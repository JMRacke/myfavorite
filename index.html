        <blockquote>
          Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of
          international .racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars
          sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The
          World Drivers ' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World
          Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing
          around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula
          in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars
          must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
          known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built
          circuits and closed public roads.
